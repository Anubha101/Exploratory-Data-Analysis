```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only 
`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than
2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```

# Striking features: 

* Buyers prefer buying less than 1 carat diamonds since it's cheaper.

* If a buyers wants to buy above 1 carat they prefer buying 1 carat, 1.5 carat, 2 carat(people barely buy between these values).

* Very less people buy diamonds below 0.25 carat and above 2 carat.

* Maximum diamonds are bought around 0.25 carat since its the cheapest.
